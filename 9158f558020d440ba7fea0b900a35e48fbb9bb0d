      "message": "Implementation is basically as suggested by Krinkle, but rather than doing raw \"window.location.href \u003d e.target.href;\" upon completion, I wanted to \"resume\" the event and let default behaviour take care of it. This way, it can be applied to more events than just clicking a link.\nThat said, the \"problem\" with this implementation is that, when this function if bound only once, it will rebind itself upon executing.\n\nAnyway, if this is a bit too far-fetched, I can easily make it just execute \"window.location.href \u003d e.target.href;\" rather than re-firing the event, because:\n- no clicktracking is being done right now\n- if/when a new round of clicktracking is supposed to happen, we should replace $.trackActionWithInfo (ClickTracking extension) by EventLogging extension, so this code will be redundant anyway\nWe just need a quick \"solution\" to not depend on E3Experiments extension (which is only active on enwiki)",
