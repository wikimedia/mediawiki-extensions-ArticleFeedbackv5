They could do this before if they overflowed the  cookie (20 feedback-ids?).  It\u0027s not a big deal.\n\nPossibly the utils module could have a \"rewriteCookies\" that reads the old cookies, reformats them to new, and deletes the old. This would also clean up obsolete cookies: the feedback-ids only lasts one month, but my ext.articleFeedbackv5@11-activity won\u0027t expire until 2014.",
