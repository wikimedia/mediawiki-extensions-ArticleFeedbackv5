      "message": "I have not seen this pattern often. It took me a while to understand why it is indeed superior.\n\nYou *can* achieve the same with this code:\n\n$msg \u003d new RawMessage( \u0027This should [[not]] be a link\u0027 );\necho $msg-\u003eescaped();\n\nThe problem with this approach is that is depends entirely on the code that is *using* the message. The code that constructs the message does not tell if it is meant to be a wikitext message, a HTML one, or a plain text one.\n\nThe pattern with the $1 does make this clear. It is plain text, and there is no way to accidentally use it in another way.",
