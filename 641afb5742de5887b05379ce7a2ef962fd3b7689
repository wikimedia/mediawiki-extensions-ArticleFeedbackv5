You can\u0027t fix this with a join, you\u0027ll have to query the page ID for its namespace+title, run that through Title::makeTitle(), ask for the expanded name with -\u003egetPrefixedDBKey(), then feed that to a second query to get the logging data. We already have a second query to fetch additional data, you could put it in there.",
